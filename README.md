## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `npm run start` command.
- Once the server has started go to `localhost:3000/urls` in your browser
- You will be required to register for an account (this account will only exist temporarily while the server is running)
- Once registered you will automatically be logged in and can create new shortened urls!

## Notes
- You can access shortened URLs by clicking on the hyperlink in the urls_show page or by going to `localhost:3000/u/shortenedURL` where `shortenedURL` is the specific tinyURL you are trying to access
- Please note that you can only modify url's that belong to your account, you will automatically be redirected when trying to access and or modify a url that does not belong to you. 
- You will still be able to access shortened urls that do not belong to you by going to `localhost:3000/u/shortenedURL`
